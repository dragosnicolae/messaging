# messaging

Using [socket.io](https://socket.io/), implement a simple messaging application (no user interface required) that has the following features:

- when a client connects, it announces its identity to the server (username). If it fails to do so, the server will disconnect it after 2 seconds
- if the identity is already taken, the client is informed and disconnected
- if the identity is available, the server sends a broadcast to the connected clients (minus the new one), informing them about the fact that a new one joined. Moreover, the server sends a list of connected clients to the newly connected one. This way, every client knows who is present in the chat room
- a client can send a message to another one, using its identity. Based on the identity, the server knows on which connection to send the message
- a client can send a message to all the other clients (broadcast)
- when a client disconnects, the server informs the remaining clients about this event

Implement the server using the [socket.io server](https://socket.io/docs/server-api/).
Implement some test clients using the [socket.io client](https://socket.io/docs/client-api/).

Make use of the [socket.io events](https://socket.io/get-started/chat/#Emitting-events) to define each operation type. You can design the API anyway you want and can use any other module you think is useful.
